# RustyTorch

### Recreating PyTorch from scratch (Rust + Python)

**RustyTorch** is a deep learning framework constructed using Rust and Python.

The main objective of **RustyTorch** was to give a brief understanding of how a
deep learning framework works internally, and to use Rust bindings in Python.

This is a personal project for educational purposes only!
