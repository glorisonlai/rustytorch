# 1 - About

**RustyTorch** is a deep learning framework constructed using Rust and Python.
This is a personal project with educational purpose only!
This has **NO** claims to rivaling the already established PyTorch.
The main objective of **RustyTorch** was to give a brief understanding of how a
deep learning framework works internally, and to use Rust bindings in Python.
It implements the Tensor object.
