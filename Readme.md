# 1 - About

**RustyTorch** is a deep learning framework constructed using Rust and Python.
This is a personal project with educational purpose only!
`Norch` means **NOT** PyTorch, and we have **NO** claims to rivaling the already established PyTorch.
The main objective of **PyNorch** was to give a brief understanding of how a deep learning framework works internally.
It implements the Tensor object.
